# Alex Nivelle's personal website

This is based on a template: [Accessible Astro Starter][template-site]. I'm
using this as a quicker way to develop a nice-looking portfolio site for myself,
because I am not a web developer, nor am I particularly interested in learning
web dev in depth. That said, I think the frameworks and possibilities presented
with this template are interesting and will still provide me with a lot of
customizability.
